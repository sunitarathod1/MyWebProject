    <h4>THE DESIFOOD</h4>
    <span>the foods and methods of their preparation traditional to India. India does not have a single cuisine. Due to its wide variety of climates, soil types, cultures, and religions, as well as influences from other countries, India has a diverse range of cuisines. As a whole, Indian cuisine can be dated to the prehistoric period and can be found across the world wherever there is a significant Indian diaspora. Indian cuisine has also played a key role in global history, Indian spices being a goal of the European Age of Discovery.</span><br><br>
    <span>The cuisine of northern India shows a stronger influence of the Islamic conquest. Dairy products such as milk, ghee, and paneer (cottage cheese) are commonly used, and many vegetables are cooked in yogurt or onion-and-tomatoâ€“based gravies. A griddle is used to make flatbread such as roti, while a tandoor (a cylindrical coal-fired oven) is used to cook flatbreads such as naan and kulcha. Puri and similar breads are deep-fried in oil, usually groundnut oil. Flatbread is typically eaten with cooked lentils (dal) and vegetables. The nonvegetarian cuisine of kebabs and pilaf is very similar to what is found in Pakistan. A popular snack is the samosa, which is cooked potato stuffed in flour and then deep-fried in oil. Street foods such as kachori and chaat are very popular, as well as sweets (called mithai) such as gulab jamun, petha, and rasmalai. Food of this region is typically richly spiced. Variations exist within northern India, from the desert regions of Rajasthan, which see heavy use of gram flour in dishes, to the vales of Kashmir, where ingredients such as mutton and dry fruits are used in dishes typically served in a wazwan, or multicourse meal.</span>
